        <p>MIP-MLP is preprocessing tool for 16S values.</p>
        <p>The input file should contain detailed unormalized OTU/Feature values, and the appopriate taxonomy as a csv file,</p>
        <p>and a possible tag file, with the class of each sample. See Example page for the formal of the input files. Note that the OTU file should have a taxonomy column in it.</p>
        <p>The tag file is not used for the preprocessing, but is used to provide some statistics on the relation between the features and the class.</p>
        <p>One can run MIP-MLP even without a tag file.</p>
